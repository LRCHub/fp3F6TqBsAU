If I’d kept walking and never stopped by that ticket gate
Would I have lived happily ever after, never knowing you?
 
If I hadn’t jumped over the back gate and escaped outside
The radiance from the stars above
would have turned into stains on my shoes

Stretched out on the linoleum floor
Hands scraped from handstands
It was right before dawn when dizziness hit me
upon realizing this place was also on the edge of the galaxy

I heard your voice, and desperate to deliver my answer
I sparkled, sparkled, sparkled, and cried out
The moment I jumped over the chain link fence
stumbled, and fell, the world began to take color
 
Leap out into the depths of the universe
let the plazma blast through everything in your path
Utterly mesmerized, oblivious to the bruises and scars to follow
Though we’re separated by light years
there’s no stopping me now that I’m on the move
At this moment, your voice sounds so distant
Shining on

As I pass through the access door, tiny particles pierce my skin
From the back alley, I watched as stars shot their light across the night sky
Rats scurried away frantically
 
If I hadn’t let go of your hand in that crowd
If I’d held back that spontaneous outcry
and swallowed it down hard instead
If I’d kept walking and never stopped by that ticket gate
You‘d have been nowhere to be found, and I wouldn’t be here

That day, the ball you threw struck me on the forehead
The moment I fell, I distinctly saw
A vapor trail streaking across the navy-blue sky
I realized this was love

Leap out into the depths of the universe
let the plazma blast through everything in your path
Utterly mesmerized, oblivious to any pain
Though we’re separated by light years
there’s no stopping me now that I’m on the move
At this moment, your voice sounds so distant
Shining on
